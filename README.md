# Introduction to Text Analysis with Python
Welcome to the Digital Scholarship Lab introduction to Text Analysis with Python class. In this class we'll learn the basics of text analysis:

parsing text
analyzing the text
We'll use our own home made analysis tool first, then we'll use a python library called TextBlob to use some built-in analysis tools.
